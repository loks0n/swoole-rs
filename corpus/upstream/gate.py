"""Merge sharded run.py reports and gate the hybrid on upstream.

Every PHPT that passes on upstream must pass on every other engine; anything else
exits 1. Tests failing on upstream too are reported, not hidden. Only the official
runner's PASSED counts as passed. Prints a Markdown summary; --output writes every
row as JSON.

A flagged test may be re-run (--recheck: up to 3 re-runs per engine, or one hybrid
re-run when the hybrid's first failure timed out). If upstream fails a re-run, the test
is flaky on upstream only if the hybrid passes one of its re-runs; otherwise it is a
regression. If upstream passes every re-run, any failed hybrid re-run is a regression
and passing them all is a pass on re-run. A hybrid that both passed and failed its
re-runs gets more upstream re-runs (up to 9 in all) before that verdict: a test racy
on both engines then shows an upstream failure too. Only regressions fail the gate, and
a flagged test without hybrid re-runs stays one.

A re-run whose test passed but whose runner then aborted with the heap-corruption
signature both engines hit at the same rate (#200, #406) is inconclusive: it is left out
of the verdict and re-run once more. A test whose re-runs on an engine are all
inconclusive fails the gate, labelled inconclusive.
