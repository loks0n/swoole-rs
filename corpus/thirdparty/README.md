# Pinned third-party Hyperf application

This corpus runs the unchanged
[Hyperf application skeleton](https://github.com/hyperf/hyperf-skeleton) at commit
`855dd7ef145d9e1e3d0500d958ac55d51cbf6ef0`. The source archive and dependency lock
SHA-256 values are recorded in `manifest.json`. It is a real framework skeleton,
not a production business application.

Prepare explicitly, once; this is the only step that accesses the network:

```sh
python3 corpus/thirdparty/hyperf.py --prepare
```

This clones into `target/thirdparty/hyperf`, checks out the exact commit, copies
the checked-in `composer.lock`, and runs Composer install with **no dev packages,
no scripts and no plugins**. `--composer` chooses a Composer executable. Normal
test runs never fetch source or resolve/install dependencies; missing inputs fail
with an actionable error. Runtime dependencies are pinned to 82 packages. The
lock was resolved from the unchanged application's `composer.json`, using the
five temporary Symfony 7 constraints recorded in the manifest to avoid host PHP
8.5 selecting PHP-8.4-only runtime packages. Do not use `composer update` during
preparation. Development-only lock entries are not installed.

Run upstream and hybrid sequentially:

```sh
python3 corpus/thirdparty/hyperf.py \
  --engine upstream=/absolute/path/to/upstream/swoole.so \
  --engine hybrid=/absolute/path/to/hybrid/swoole.so \
  --output target/reports/thirdparty-hyperf.json
```

`--php` selects PHP; repeat `--php-extension` for required extra modules, including
PDO/SQLite and tokenizer where these are not compiled into PHP. Requirements include Swoole's
HTTP server, coroutines, coroutine HTTP client, PDO SQLite and the framework's
PHP extensions from the lock. Swoole short names are explicitly disabled as
required by Hyperf. The driver uses the common `Engine.command` and process-group
cleanup helpers. It does not substitute the prototype's HTTP API for Swoole's
framework integration.

## What executes

Every engine gets a disposable tree extracted from the pinned Git archive, the
checked lock and copied prepared vendor directory. The tracked source must be
clean and at the expected commit. The driver verifies the archive/lock hashes,
installed package versions/source references against the lock, and every tracked
file's unchanged bytes after the run. It permits generated runtime/vendor files;
no controller, route, server option, container definition or app dependency is
edited. Dependency contents rely on Composer's installation; the installed
metadata comparison is not a full vendor-content attestation.

1. Start the normal `bin/hyperf.php start` entry point. The unchanged server binds
   `0.0.0.0:9501` and uses `swoole_cpu_num()` workers (14 on the measured Mac).
   The driver refuses to start if that port is already occupied. Run this corpus
   serially on an isolated test host/container because the application fixes its
   listening port and worker count.
2. Check six actual application requests: default GET, UTF-8/query decoding,
   JSON POST, form POST, a 404 and the empty favicon route. Expected GET/POST
   JSON is compared exactly. A final request checks surviving server health.
3. In an **external probe**, initialize the unchanged application's actual
   classloader/container. Use its Hyperf Guzzle `ClientFactory` inside a Hyperf
   coroutine with hook flags zero, selecting the framework's `CoroutineHandler`
   for a local HTTP request. Verify its exact response.
4. Use Hyperf's existing `Cache\\Driver\\SqliteDriver`, with explicit external
   probe configuration pointing to a disposable SQLite file, to persist a UTF-8
   value containing a NUL byte. Verify the value through that driver and the
   database row count. A second independent PHP process reads it, then a third
   reads it after the whole HTTP server exits. This exercises framework cache,
   pooling, serialization, coordinator teardown and disk persistence.
5. Send SIGTERM to the isolated master, require normal exit 0 and listener
   closure. Always clean up the owned process group on failure or timeout. Never
   run broad Swoole cleanup scripts. The external cache probe resumes Hyperf's
   worker-exit coordinator so its housekeeping coroutine can end normally.

The external probe is explicitly harness code, not an unchanged application
endpoint. This skeleton has no persistence or outbound-I/O route. These checks
therefore **do not** claim end-to-end controller-to-database coverage, MySQL/
Redis integration, SQLite coroutine hook coverage, production load, all-worker
health, or general resource-leak detection. Hook flags zero still exercise
Hyperf's coroutine HTTP handler; PDO SQLite operations are synchronous.

The initial attempted `DB_DRIVER=sqlite` probe failed because this pinned
Hyperf database factory supports MySQL, not SQLite. That failure is retained in
`target/reports/hyperf-probe-initial.json`; using the framework's already supplied
SQLite cache driver is an external persistence probe with the narrower scope
above. No assertion in an original application/upstream test was changed.
`hyperf-initial.json` preserves an earlier Python-version extraction API error.

## Local evidence

`target/reports/thirdparty-hyperf.json` records the application/lock, driver/probe
hashes, exact PHP/extension identities, six HTTP cases, framework I/O/persistence
checks, graceful shutdown and post-shutdown persistence. The final macOS run
passes against pinned upstream and immutable hybrid build
`eabd353e98e260652f576c59240f0d457b9a25b492e1e18499ae27cd89c8a612`.
Application corpus registration and result counting belong to the integrator.

Linux PHP 8.2.35 validation also passes against upstream and the selected combined
dev hybrid: `target/linux-dev/target/reports/thirdparty-hyperf-linux.json`.
The first Linux attempt without `--php-extension tokenizer` failed during
classloader startup and is preserved as `thirdparty-hyperf-linux-initial.json`.
Prepared pure-PHP source/vendor inputs were copied from the same verified lock;
no Linux dependency re-resolution or application changes were made.
