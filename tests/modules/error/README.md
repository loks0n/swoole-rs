# Error handling

Reference: Swoole v6.2.4, commit `c7e514509451beafd4d70ce5b78943d51e76381c`.
The opt-in error overlay (feature bit 32) replaces first-party message lookup,
error classification, unknown-message formatting and ignored-error membership
in `src/core/error.cc`.

The `swr_v1_error_message` ABI in `docs/core-abi-v1.md` and
`native/include/swoole_rs_error.h` is unchanged: 130 exact static C strings,
null on misses, no allocation, callbacks or mutable state. Numeric gaps and
upstream spelling are intentional. Module-local additive APIs and their
lifetime rules are in `native/error/contract.md`.

Rust behaviour:

- Codes below 500 go to the native OS `strerror` callback; known codes return
  immutable pointers; other codes are formatted without allocation.
- Unknown messages use one mutable 32-byte buffer. Apple colon spelling, NUL,
  trailing bytes and pointer reuse match native. Callers must serialize
  unknown-buffer calls, as upstream requires; known lookups are thread-safe.
- Ignored errors use a lazy process-local Rust HashSet behind an opaque native
  handle: idempotent insert, fallible allocation, copied-on-fork state and
  destruction match native. Concurrent mutation is excluded; initialized
  read-only access may be concurrent. Native code throws `bad_alloc` after Rust
  returns.

Native code keeps the OS call, C++ exception construction/throw, the opaque
handle holder/destructor and the shared `sw_error` storage. No Zend values, PHP
callbacks or bailout enter Rust.

## Correctness

```sh
cargo test -p swoole-rs-error
cargo clippy -p swoole-rs-error --all-targets -- -D warnings
python3 tests/modules/error/differential.py --source PINNED_REFERENCE --sanitize --output REPORT
python3 tests/modules/error/differential.py --source PINNED_REFERENCE --archive PUBLISHED_ARCHIVE --sanitize --output REPORT
python3 tests/modules/error/differential.py --source PINNED_REFERENCE --allocator-faults --sanitize --output REPORT
python3 tests/modules/error/php.py --source PINNED_REFERENCE --engine upstream=CONTROL --engine hybrid=CANDIDATE --output REPORT
```

`differential.py` reads pinned Git objects, applies checksum-verified patches in
a disposable tree and compiles the complete original and patched `error.cc`;
only dependency declarations and external buffer storage are stubbed. It checks
all 130 messages, 10414 numeric inputs, the original exception/state
assertions, concurrent lookups and reads, 20000 state operations, duplicates,
signed values, fork isolation and child destruction, plus full callback and
32-byte unknown-buffer assertions.

`--allocator-faults` links the unchanged Rust module with a test global
allocator against the native facade: bucket, handle and growth allocation
failures must preserve membership and raise native `bad_alloc` after Rust
returns; duplicates must not allocate and retries must succeed. It rejects
`--archive` and benchmark preparation.

`php.py` compares engines on 31221 `swoole_strerror` results, runs the original
`swoole_strerror.phpt` and `swoole_error_log.phpt` through PHP's official runner,
and drives 8200 ignored-error insertions, signed/narrowed integers, fork
before/after initialization, child isolation and shutdown logging (`state.php`).
It also runs the 43 integers in `php-narrowing-cases.json` through omitted,
literal-zero, SYSTEM and SWOOLE selectors. It requires pcntl and 64-bit PHP, and
requires both native-error and Rust-error feature identities so two native
builds cannot satisfy parity. Compare bytes within one platform: OS messages
differ across platforms.

`--sanitize` instruments C++ only, not the Rust archive.

Gate audit (#471/#478): both phases are **kept**. `error-native` runs the native
error allocator/state facades under C++ sanitizers — coverage no PHPT, Rust unit
test or fuzz target reaches (rule 1, sanitizers). `error-php` uniquely checks the
43-case `swoole_strerror` integer-narrowing corpus (64-bit PHP int → C error code
across the FFI) under four selectors on both engines, which no PHPT exercises.
(The two unchanged originals it also runs, `swoole_function/swoole_strerror.phpt`
and `swoole_error_log.phpt`, are already run by the merge-tier PHPT gate, so only
the narrowing corpus is unique to this phase.)

## Benchmarks

Prepare (correctness checks, optimized consumers, state `--check` and
`--check-latency` with clocks disabled; the destination must not exist):

```sh
python3 tests/modules/error/differential.py --source PINNED_REFERENCE --archive PUBLISHED_ARCHIVE --prepare-benchmark NEW_DIRECTORY --output REPORT
```

Measure, without concurrent workloads:

```sh
python3 tests/modules/error/benchmark.py --prepared PREPARED --output MESSAGE_REPORT
python3 tests/modules/error/benchmark.py --prepared PREPARED --state --output STATE_REPORT
python3 tests/modules/error/benchmark.py --prepared PREPARED --state --latency --output STATE_LATENCY_REPORT
```

The runner verifies the prepared binary hashes, runs seven alternating pairs
and kills its private process group on timeout. Message workloads: all known
codes, hot code, system errors and unknown errors. State workloads: mixed-sign
hit/miss/duplicate at 8 and 4096 entries, fresh insertion at 4096 and 65536
entries, and four-thread read-only hit/miss at 4096 entries; each sample forks
from the same empty parent. `--latency` reports p50/p95/p99 of batch-mean
nanoseconds per operation (about 128 batches), not per-call tail latency.

## Known gaps

- The last published throughput (ten-module build, before full Rust formatting
  and state) was 0.82x upstream on macOS and 1.04x on Linux. The macOS
  regression blocks default activation; current state/unknown timings have not
  been measured.
