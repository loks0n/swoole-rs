# M18 framing and MIME

Packet framing and the immutable MIME policy behind the optional framing feature
(bit4096). The native C++ container and the native IO/callback/storage ABI shims
are described in [native/framing/contract.md](../../../native/framing/contract.md).
Default activation is not claimed.

## Gates

`tools/dev.py` runs `gate.py` (framing-native), `trace.py` (framing-traces), `core.py`
(framing-native-originals, Linux) and the versioned `wrong_eof_setting.phpt` expectation.

```sh
mkdir -p target/reports
python3 tests/modules/framing/trace.py --output target/reports/framing-trace.json
rustc --edition=2024 --crate-type=staticlib --crate-name swoole_rs_framing \
  -O -Dwarnings crates/framing/src/lib.rs -o target/libframing.a
python3 tests/modules/framing/gate.py --archive target/libframing.a \
  --sanitize --output target/reports/framing-gate.json
```

- `trace.py` compiles the exact pinned C++ bodies and the same files with
  `migration/patches/framing` applied
  against instrumented IO/String boundaries and compares the traces line by
  line. The traces cover partial packets, split residuals, callback
  failure/removal ordering, reentry, TLS pending, allocation exceptions and
  dynamic-header offset/body/header_len ordering.
- `gate.py` runs the ABI, catalog, locale-suffix and malformed-input checks in
  `gate.cc`. Add `--rust-asan` with an instrumented archive to also require
  that a one-past read in the invalid caller is detected.
- `core.py --source S --config config.h --archive A --build-root DIR --output R`
  needs Linux with CMake, GTest and PHP. It builds the unchanged pinned native
  GoogleTests for the reference and the framing overlay, and runs each test
  separately. Any error, skip or missing outcome fails. `--inventory-only`
  lists the tests without building.
- Upstream PHPTs for this module run in the merge tier's PHPT gate (the `phpt-*` jobs), which runs every pinned PHPT on upstream and the all-modules hybrid. To attribute a gate regression to this module, see *Attributing a regression* in [corpus/upstream/README.md](../../../corpus/upstream/README.md).

## Known failures

- PHP originals: macOS has 43 pass, 2 skip and 2 fail; Linux has 45 pass,
  1 skip and 1 fail. Both engines get the same results.
- On macOS, `If_Modified_Since.phpt` returns 200 instead of 304 in both engines.
- The SMTP online test skips. macOS also skips the Linux-only large-packet test.
- Under the 128-byte allocation ceiling, both engines throw for a 1MiB filename
  prefix, because the reference copies the whole filename too. This is not a
  migration regression. The uncapped control matches on both platforms.
- Still open: optimized measurements, broader platform/feature/combined
  activation, and the remaining original failures.
