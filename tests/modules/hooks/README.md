Each `*_gate.py` extracts the pinned and patched function bodies, compiles both
against a deterministic native facade (`*_fixture.h`) and runs identical
scenarios through each, comparing effects and order. Syscalls, contexts, TLS
and kernel IO are faked; these are policy/order checks, not runtime proof.
`--sanitize` adds ASan/UBSan to C++ only, not the Rust archive.

- `ordered_gate.py` (2021 cases): hook guard short circuit; flock routing,
  retry, cancel and invalid precedence; socket partial reads/writes, barrier
  wait/error/EOF/timer failure and retry policy; recvmsg/sendmsg/sendto/recvfrom
  paths; UringSocket partial IO and io_uring submission; system poll
  error-to-read/write mapping; wait/poll and `System::wait_event`;
  TimerController start/destructor; 121 requested/installed hook flag pairs
  including the native/PHP curl conflict; all 19 stream/transport/PDO/function
  families; MongoDB install-only aliases.
- `async_gate.py` (434 cases): async event/lambda/sleep/DNS bodies, including
  dispatch rejection, timeout/cancel completion, late canceled completion,
  resume-deletes-event lifetime and errno capture.
- `packet_gate.py` (624 cases): length/EOF/raw framing paths and vectored
  all-transfer paths with EAGAIN/EINTR/error/partial progress.
- `socket_policy_gate.py` (420 cases): Socket header and TimeoutController
  bodies: read/write CID diagnostics, close/exception, closed/null sockets,
  error priority, exact timeout bits and clock phases.
- `lifecycle_gate.py` (1249 cases): shutdown, cancel, close after resume,
  destructor reentry, connect EINTR/EINPROGRESS/timer/option outcomes,
  liveness errno and native exception unwind order.

`compile_gate.py` compiles all eight original and patched translation units as
C++14 using the given `config.h`, and checks that each overlay refuses to
compile when `config.h` does not define `SWOOLE_RS_HOOKS`. io_uring units are
reported UNSUPPORTED when the config does not enable `SW_USE_IOURING`.

## Original tests

```sh
python3 tests/modules/hooks/upstream.py --source PINNED_SOURCE --engine upstream=CONTROL --engine hybrid=CANDIDATE --output REPORT
python3 tests/modules/hooks/core.py --receipt upstream=NATIVE_CORE_RECEIPT --receipt hybrid=NATIVE_CORE_RECEIPT --output REPORT
```

`upstream.py` runs 229 original PHPTs (147 runtime, 62 socket_coro, 18
coroutine_system, 2 io_uring) through PHP's official runner with unchanged
assertions, restoring the pinned helper and data files the tests need.
`--group`/`--case` select subsets; a subset cannot pass the full gate.
`--external-network` includes cases that need outside services.

`core.py` runs the 100 primary native GoogleTest declarations listed in
`originals.json` (plus the `accept` dependency) against completed
`tools/native_core.py` builds, after verifying the original assertion files,
executable and loaded library match the receipt. It runs the unchanged
`base.file_put_contents` test first to create `TEST_TMP_FILE`.

## Known failures

- PHPTs (229), PASS/FAIL/SKIP: Linux reference 183/14/32 vs Rust 181/16/32;
  macOS reference 165/19/45 vs Rust 161/23/45. Rust has candidate-only
  failures on both platforms; base/async_file failures reproduce in the native
  control on macOS. Redis, external services and PHP deprecations account for
  further failures and skips.
- Native originals (101, Linux): reference 93 pass/8 fail, Rust 94 pass/7
  fail. Both fail tcp6, four external proxy cases and two DNS cases; the
  reference TLS verify case timed out. An earlier run showed TLS SIGPIPE in both
  engines.
- Not run: enabled io_uring runtime, ZTS/thread mode, the PHP originals after
  the latest wait/poll, retry, datagram and curl/MongoDB policy moves, and
  performance.
