# Locks validation

Opt-in Rust implementations (feature bit 1024) cover mutex, reader/writer,
spin, barrier and coroutine-lock policy. PHP Lock and Thread Lock keep their
native Zend facades and call Rust through the real classes. Atomic/Long and
Thread Atomic/Long are Rust classes (`crates/phplocks`, see
[docs/zend.md](../../../docs/zend.md)) over the same atomic words. See
[native/locks/contract.md](../../../native/locks/contract.md) for geometry,
ownership, timeout, ordering, fork and coroutine contracts, and
[PLATFORMS.md](PLATFORMS.md) for the macOS/Linux platform guard.

`overlay.py` applies `migration/patches/locks/` to the pinned sources for the gates;
edit the patches with `tools/patches.py`.

```sh
python3 tools/build_hybrid.py --module locks --dev --jobs 2
python3 tests/modules/locks/gate.py --source target/upstream/src \
  --archive target/release/libswoole_rs_ffi.a --sanitize
```

## Native gate

- `gate.py --source S --archive A [--sanitize] [--rust-asan] [--output R]`
  (`locks-native`): compiles the pinned pthread bodies and the Rust overlay
  facades into one driver (`gate.cc`) and compares thread/fork/RW/timeout/
  barrier/atomic/futex behaviour (about 160,000 checks). `--rust-asan` also
  requires the archive's ASan imports to detect a deliberate one-past pointer
  passed to `swr_v1_locks_coroutine_try`. For a Rust-ASan archive on Linux:

  ```sh
  RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 RUSTFLAGS='-Zsanitizer=address -Zexternal-clangrt=yes' \
    cargo rustc --locked --offline -p swoole-rs-locks --release \
    --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --target-dir target/locks-rust-asan \
    --crate-type staticlib
  ```

- Upstream PHPTs for this module run in the merge tier's PHPT gate (the `phpt-*` jobs), which runs every pinned PHPT on upstream and the all-modules hybrid. To attribute a gate regression to this module, see *Attributing a regression* in [corpus/upstream/README.md](../../../corpus/upstream/README.md).

## Other gates

- `core.py --source S --config CONFIG_H --archive A --build-root DIR --output R`:
  builds upstream and locks-only native trees (Linux) and runs the 14 unchanged
  lock GTests one process each.
- `state.py --engine ... [--require-zts]` (`locks-state`, integrate lane): paired PHP witness (`state.php`) for
  integer wrap, CAS, lock behaviour and coroutine mutual exclusion; under ZTS
  also real threads sharing 32/64-bit atomics. Observations must match.
- `threads.py --engine ... --php-extension sockets`: real ZTS threads with a
  barrier, 20,000 increments per Thread Atomic width and 2,000 mutex-protected
  updates. Requires ZTS engines; also used by `tests/modules/integration/zts.py`.
- `constructor.py --source S --archive A --output R [--sanitize] [--rust-asan]` (`locks-constructor`):
  lock constructors with faults injected at the native pthread init/attribute/
  pshared boundaries; checks no leaked storage, attribute cleanup, exception
  code/message and first-error propagation through the direct ABI.
- `platforms.py --source S --output R` (`locks-platforms`): compiles the header as C11/C++14 on the
  host and checks synthetic FreeBSD/Android (and Apple mobile on macOS) macros
  are rejected.
- `benchmark.py --prepare DIR --core-root CORE`, then `benchmark.py --prepared DIR`:
  mutex, rw-read, spin and atomic32 against both native libraries (Linux).
  Run timings with no other workload.
- `zts/Dockerfile` and `zts/build.py`: PHP 8.5 ZTS image and a build of
  reference and Rust thread-enabled extensions inside it (expects the repo at
  `/work`, the pinned upstream at `/reference` and a prior Linux
  `dev-rust-locks` build).

## Known failures

- `core.py` `rw_try_wr`: the upstream test relies on 1ms/2ms sleeps to make a
  try-lock contend with a held write lock, with no synchronisation. It fails
  intermittently in either engine (latest: reference failed, Rust passed).
  `gate.py` covers the same operations deterministically.
- `constructor.py`: the native baseline leaks on failed construction and is
  reported as `native_baseline_passed: false`; the gate checks the Rust rows.

## Gate audit (#487)

`locks-native` is kept. It is a thread, fork, futex and timeout differential of
the pinned pthread bodies against the Rust overlay under ASan/UBSan, with about
160,000 checks no PHPT reaches.

Three scripts that no phase ran now are phases:

- `locks-constructor`: fault injection at pthread init, attribute and pshared calls.
- `locks-platforms`: the platform guard compile.
- `locks-state`: wrap at `PHP_INT_MAX`, CAS and lock observations, which must
  match upstream.

`owned.py` is deleted. Its ordinary add, sub, cmpset, set and lock round trips
are `swoole_atomic/atomic.phpt` and `swoole_lock/{mutex,lock_read}.phpt`, which
the PHPT gate runs on both engines.

`core.py` (the 14 upstream lock GTests) still runs in no CI lane. That is #736.
