# Clients local ABI

Opt-in feature bit 1048576 (`clients`). ABI: `docs/clients-resolver-abi-v1.md`,
`swoole_rs_clients.h`, `swoole_rs_clients_pool.h`. Converted sources require
`SWOOLE_RS_CLIENTS`. Patched upstream files: `ext-src/swoole_client.cc`,
`ext-src/swoole_client_async.cc`, `ext-src/swoole_client_coro.cc`,
`ext-src/swoole_http_client_coro.cc`, `ext-src/swoole_name_resolver.cc`,
`src/network/address.cc`, `src/network/client.cc`, `src/network/dns.cc`.

35 production exports (prefix `swr_v1_clients_`). A test-only allocation-budget
symbol is excluded from production artifacts.

| Area | Exports | Rust responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address | `url`, `port`, `ip`, `loopback`, `ip_text` | URL spans; port validity; numeric bytes, original loopback policy and DNS text |
| Hosts/resolver settings | `hosts_match`, `resolv_line`, `dns_endpoint` | Borrowed line/token spans; locale/`strtol` stay native |
| DNS codec | `domain_encode`, `domain_decode` | Bounded label encoding/decoding with native `char` signedness |
| Raw lifecycle | `shutdown`, `close_next`, `object_next` | Shutdown, close and constructor/destructor order |
| Raw transport | `write_next`, `read_next`, `connect_next`, `transport_next`, `datagram_send` | Proxy/TLS/connect/read/write/datagram decisions and result narrowing |
| Persistent clients | `persistent_next`; `pool_create`, `pool_destroy`, `pool_push`, `pool_state`, `pool_take`, `pool_remove_empty` | Acquire/release decisions and private pool storage |
| PHP resolver | `resolver_next` | Lookup/cluster retry/result/context publication order |
| HTTP | `cookie`, `http_exec`, `http_connection_next`, `http_response_next`, `http_format` | Header spans; exec/retry/connection/response order; bounded output formatting |
| Coroutine Client | `coro_next` | Setup, stream/datagram IO, peek, metadata and close decisions |
| Async Client | `async_meta`, `async_event`, `async_next` | Immutable names/slots, prefix matching, freeing/connect/callback selection |

## Common rules

Scalar cursors hold no native address or object. Native code observes copied
facts at the original point, calls Rust, then performs the chosen effect. No Rust
frame or borrow spans a callback, Zend bailout, exception, IO, coroutine
suspension or destructor. Native Client/Socket/Zend fields and route function
slots stay authoritative; static callback metadata is not a mutable registry.

Borrowed spans must be initialized readable/writable storage for their stated
length (see each unsafe export). Returned offsets/lengths refer to that
caller-owned storage; no span is retained. Null/oversized inputs are rejected
defensively. Scalar/span operations allocate no Rust storage. Locale facets,
`std::stoi`/`strtol` and their exceptions/errno, buffers, strings, zvals,
parsers, crypto, descriptors and callbacks stay native.

## Persistent pool

A private native RAII facade owns one lazily created opaque Rust pool handle.
Rust stores binary keys and FIFO queues of opaque Client tokens using a
deterministic hasher and fallible allocation; there is no C++ map/queue. Only
native code closes or deletes Client tokens; dropping the Rust container never
does. On allocation failure Rust returns a status and native throws `bad_alloc`.
Unlike the original (which leaks residual heap queues at shutdown), Rust frees
its own buffers on destruction, so allocation topology differs.

## Address and raw object

- Numeric parsing stops at the first NUL of the span. Only successful 4/16-byte
  results are written into existing `sockaddr`/`tmp_address` storage.
- Apple accepts decimal leading zeros; Linux is strict. Dotted IPv6 tails are
  normalized in bounded stack storage before `std::net` parsing.
- IPv4 loopback is exactly `127.0.0.1`, not `/8`.
- `Address::assign(type, host, port, resolve)` is one Rust call,
  `clients_address_assign`: port check, then the sockaddr union and length for
  IPv4/IPv6/raw (literal, else native `gethostbyname` through a function pointer
  when resolving) or Unix (length limit, `strlcpy` copy); it returns the
  `SW_ERROR_*` code native sets as the last error. Native sets `type` first.
  `Address::verify_ip` is `clients_verify_ip` into native `tmp_address`.
- Unsupported families and Apple scoped-IPv6 parsing go to the platform's
  `inet_pton` from Rust, errno included.
- `ip_text` writes into 40-byte caller-local storage and returns the length.
  IPv6 is emitted as eight four-digit lowercase groups (as the original DNS
  helper does, not compressed `inet_ntop` text). Native builds the
  `std::string`; the invalid-family assertion stays native.
- Raw construction checks static `Socket::is_stream(type)` for fd class and the
  created `Socket::is_stream()` for dispatch. Destruction observes `async` after
  close and buffer destruction. A null Socket keeps the early return; the
  zero-fd assertion, function pointers and deletion stay native.

Tests: `tests/modules/clients/README.md`.
