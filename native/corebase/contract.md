# Core base helpers

Opt-in feature bit 8192 (`corebase`). Header: `swoole_rs_corebase.h`. Callers are
in `src/core/base.cc`. No public C++ signature or Global/ThreadGlobal layout
changes.

Rust holds numeric/byte/path comparison and formatting policy. It keeps no
state, pointers or borrows after return, performs no allocation, and calls no
native allocator, user callback, Zend operation or C++ constructor. Host libc
`strtoul`, `strncasecmp` and `toupper` are called directly so locale and errno
behave as upstream; input strings must stay valid for the call. No exception,
bailout or panic crosses the ABI. All spans and pointer differences fit
`PTRDIFF_MAX`. Native `long`/`unsigned long` map to Rust `c_long`/`c_ulong`.

## Helpers

- `type_size`: original ASCII character mapping; unknown returns 0.
- `gcd` / `lcm`: native facades keep both positive-input assertions. LCM wraps
  the `uint32` product before division (65536*65536 -> 0). Rust uses Euclid's
  remainder loop. Native LCM's unsigned-to-int conversion above `INT_MAX` is
  implementation-defined.
- `itoa`: writes decimal bytes then NUL into caller-owned storage and returns the
  length. Handles `LONG_MIN`. Buffers need only fit the
  actual value.
- `radix`: base 2..36, writes backwards into scratch of at least
  `sizeof(unsigned long)*8+1`. Returns `SIZE_MAX` without writing for invalid
  radix, null output or short capacity. The facade keeps its assertion and calls
  the original `sw_strndup` after Rust returns.
- `hex`: accepts all ASCII A..Z/a..z (as upstream, beyond F). Counts an optional
  `0x` prefix even without digits, wraps `size_t` per digit, then converts to
  `unsigned long`. The facade passes its compiler's plain-`char` signedness
  (`hex_mode`); in unsigned mode all bytes go to `toupper` as non-negative.
  Output must be writable and disjoint from input.
- `version`: calls host `strtoul` left then right on every component, keeping
  sticky errno/ERANGE and platform differences. Skips exactly one arbitrary
  separator between equal components.
- `parse_stoi`: host decimal `strtol`, accepted only within `int` range. The
  facade first builds the same `std::string` upstream's `std::stoi` needed (same
  `bad_alloc` point), saves and clears errno, captures ERANGE and restores errno.
  Output is written only on success; on no-conversion or out-of-range it reruns
  native `std::stoi` so the original exception is thrown.
- `dirname`: returns the last-slash prefix length, preserving root and
  binary/NUL bytes; no slash returns empty.
- `hook_add_action`: stateless decision for hook-list creation and front/back
  insertion. Native allocates and mutates the list and owns callbacks.

## `mkdir_next`

Bounded path copying and component iteration. The native stack owns a
zero-initialized two-`size_t` state and a `PATH_MAX` scratch buffer. Return
values: 1 = next NUL-cut prefix is ready for native `access(R_OK)`/`mkdir(0755)`
(the next call restores the slash and continues); 0 = done; 2 = emit the original
too-long warning; 3 = invalid state/storage. Input, output and state must be
disjoint; state/output must not change between steps.

Order matches upstream: raw `std::string` length check first, then copy up to the
first NUL, with the trailing-slash decision taken from the last raw byte, so
embedded-NUL paths keep upstream's odd behavior. Repeated slashes and
relative/root prefixes are not normalized. Empty input and a full `PATH_MAX-1`
string needing an appended slash are undefined upstream; Rust rejects them.

## `lifecycle_next`

Returns typed native actions from a zeroed 8-byte caller-stack phase/index
cursor. Each reentrant call uses its own cursor. Invalid cursor/operation returns
`UINT32_MAX`, which the native shim aborts on; callers zero-initialize and stop
on DONE.

| Operation | Meaning | Argument |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | thread init | is main thread |
| 2 | thread cleanup | - |
| 3 | Global cleanup | native hook count |
| 4 | `swoole_fork` | - |
| 5 | `swoole_fork_exec` | - |

Native shims perform exactly one requested effect per step.

- Global cleanup observes hook slots one at a time (a destructor may add a later
  list before its observation point), keeps deleting-list pointers published and
  never revisits a deleted slot. Then: clear signals, clean the thread,
  conditionally close the current logger, delete the logger and memory pool, and
  reset Global last. Pointers are re-read after each close/delete.
- Thread init: observe the stack buffer, allocate when absent, block signals only
  for non-main threads, then publish `main_thread`. An allocation exception stops
  later effects.
- Thread cleanup: observe/free timer, then reactor, then observe/delete/null the
  buffer.
- Fork: native flags are checked with `static_assert`. After the fork effect the
  copied observation is 0 = failure, 1 = child, 2 = parent; Rust keeps no pid.
  PRECHECK returns before fork; child DAEMON returns before timer observation and
  overrides EXEC. Failed fork warns, sleeps once, then retries. Fork-exec failure
  returns `pid_t(0)` without warning or retry; the child callback runs before
  native `exit(0)`. A returning fatal handler resumes the sequence; throwing or
  exiting handlers never re-enter Rust.

`init_next` also selects the `SW_MAX(1, sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN))` CPU
branch: native runs the first query, reports only `< 1`, then either assigns 1 or
runs the second query and assigns.

Still native: varargs, globals, C++ containers/objects, entropy, filesystem IO,
hook traversal, clocks and other runtime operations.
