# Coroutine I/O policy contract

Opt-in feature bit 65536 (`hooks`). ABI: `docs/hooks-abi-v1.md` and
`swoole_rs_hooks.h`. Patched upstream files: `ext-src/swoole_runtime.cc`,
`include/swoole_coroutine_socket.h`, `src/coroutine/file.cc`,
`src/coroutine/file_lock.cc`, `src/coroutine/hook.cc`,
`src/coroutine/iouring.cc`, `src/coroutine/socket.cc`,
`src/coroutine/system.cc`, `src/coroutine/uring_socket.cc`.

All exports are allocation-free, callback-free decisions over copied scalars.
They never read or write errno/last_error. Native code owns socket maps, objects,
IO, callbacks, queues, timers, context switches, PHP function/transport
registries and error publication. No user-buffer borrow or Rust frame survives
a native operation, and native exceptions unwind only native frames. Public
declarations and layouts are unchanged.

## Hooks and file locks

- `hook_no_coro` keeps the reactor/current-coroutine guard only at its existing
  call site; DNS hooks without that guard are unchanged.
- `swoole_coroutine_flock` is one Rust call, `hook_coroutine_flock`: outside a
  coroutine (native passes no sleep) or with `LOCK_NB` it is plain flock; `LOCK_UN`
  unlocks; `LOCK_EX`/`LOCK_SH` retry `flock(op | LOCK_NB)` only on -1/EWOULDBLOCK,
  sleeping through `System::sleep` with the `wait_for` backoff, and fail when that
  sleep is cancelled; anything else is invalid, for native to raise EINVAL.
- `hook_file_result` rejects open fd 0 and does not reset close's fd.
- `wait_for` uses a copied caller-local delay/phase/result plan selecting the
  next callback, sleep, success or canceled return. Backoff: capped doubling with
  reset.

## Runtime hook transitions

Requested flags are compared with installed flags per family (21 families,
including curl and MongoDB's install-only alias path), with no Rust registry.
Capability filtering runs after the before-hook callback and before
stream/PDO/function/MongoDB/after-hook/publication. Requested config flags and
installed flags stay distinct. Curl conflict normalization is a copied
by-value plan: the native warning runs before normalized flags are published and
before Rust reads installed flags again, so PHP warning handlers can re-enter or
throw safely. MongoDB class lookup/alias registration stay native, and aliases
are still never uninstalled.

## Socket IO

- recv/send/read/write/readv/writev/recvmsg/sendmsg share a retry cursor. Order:
  IO -> negative-result classifier -> timer start -> wait -> IO. EOF/success
  never classifies or waits. Send/write wait callbacks may replace the buffer
  pointer; the next IO uses the current native value. msghdr/iovec/ancillary
  ownership and the non-global-buffer requirement are unchanged.
- sendto/recvfrom use an interrupted-result cursor: negative EINTR retries
  immediately, before classifier/timer/wait. Stream/message EINTR keeps the
  classifier path. errno enters only as a copied interrupted flag after trace.
- Transfer-all snapshots hold total bytes and a bool. Native classifies negative
  results first; Rust updates unsigned progress and decides barrier continuation.
  Partial error returns completed bytes; error without progress returns -1.
  Zero-length do/while still executes once. Vectored transfer accumulates only
  positive progress and picks the next vector after native updates it. Signed
  accumulation is defined only within `ssize_t`.
- Header policy uses copied event masks/binding facts to select the read or write
  coroutine field (read wins). CID queries and fatal bound diagnostics stay
  native and run first. Availability observes native closed state first, then
  selects EBADF / close-wait / success. Return-value policy selects
  clear / errno-publication / retain without reading errno eagerly.
- Timeouts: timeval conversion keeps the original two float divisions. The
  timeout controller selects no-clock / initial-clock / elapsed-clock phase, then
  remaining-time arithmetic with strict minimum comparison. NaN, non-positive,
  infinite timeouts and zero startup keep pinned behavior.
- Lifecycle: shutdown admission and syscall mask (including success with
  ENOTCONN), bound-before-event cancel precedence, close precheck/bound
  decisions, connect EINTR/EINPROGRESS/failure and `SO_ERROR`, liveness
  errno/reset fallback. Close selectors are stateless over the native fields:
  binding is observed after native shutdown, and each cancel re-observes bindings
  after the previous resume. Native detaches the fd and clears the copied dtor
  before invoking it. Terminal resume/dtor may delete the owner; nothing touches
  it afterward. Publication order is read then write; `connected` is cleared only
  when both are set. Failed `getsockopt` keeps the stale errCode as upstream.
- Packet framing: header parsing, negative/zero/oversize length
  classification, partial-read result, bounded EOF window/growth and
  length-before-EOF-before-raw dispatch. Native EOF scanning still precedes
  max-length rejection; equality at the limit and the minimum-EOF early-continue
  are unchanged. Buffers, protocol callbacks and syscalls stay native.

## Poll, events and timers

- Poll readiness takes requested/received/current/read-write/error masks and
  returns coalesced revents. Explicitly requested error bits stay error bits;
  otherwise error maps to requested read/write. Native updates its map row before
  claiming the single deferred wake, clears its timer and defers cleanup/resume
  once.
- `EventWaiter` computes event bits and single-defer selection before native
  defer runs; a deferred terminal resume may delete its owner.
- `System::wait_event` is one Rust call, `hook_wait_event`: it masks to read/write
  (none is EINVAL), answers a zero timeout with one `poll(2)` (POLLNVAL is EBADF,
  nothing ready is ETIMEDOUT), and otherwise runs native's `EventWaiter` through a
  function pointer, then turns error readiness into the requested read/write bits.
  Native sets the last error and errno it returns.
- `System::wait_signal` is one Rust call, `hook_wait_signal`: the listener table,
  the EBUSY/EINVAL checks, registering through native `listen`, the park, the wake-up handler
  `hook_signal_wake` (clears the slot, records the signal, resumes) and the
  unregistering after it. Native passes the coroutine operations, signal
  registration (deferred under `SW_USE_THREAD_CONTEXT`), the reactor exit condition
  and `signal_async_listener_num`.
- `TimerController` selects activation/addition/negative-timeout sentinel and
  enabled-only destruction. Disabled destructors and zero-timeout starts do not
  dereference `timer_pp`. Positive allocation failure leaves enabled = true with
  a null pointer; existing non-null timers are not re-armed.
- `System::sleep` minimum keeps NaN/Inf/non-positive comparisons and
  get-current/`yield_ex`/is-canceled order.

## Async tasks, DNS and io_uring

- Async admission/yield/callback: dispatch failure returns before yielding;
  cancellable yield failure selects native cancellation publication; an
  already-canceled completion never reads `event.object` or resumes. Typed-event
  cancellation publishes canceled -> retval -> last-error; success publishes
  canceled -> error/errno -> retval. Callback resume may delete the event.
- DNS async-timeout error mapping is scalar policy in both host/address lookup
  wrappers; requests, parsing, cache and c-ares/libc stay native.
- io_uring: CQ harvesting, SQ admission and task counter decrement stay native
  and precede resume. Rust maps negative CQ results (ECANCELED -> ETIMEDOUT).
  Submit keeps EAGAIN defer, EBUSY sleep, EINTR retry and the native fatal
  diagnostic. Behavior on io_uring-enabled kernels is untested.

Known native races (cancellation fields, unhandled worker exceptions) are
unchanged.
