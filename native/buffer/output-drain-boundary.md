# Buffer output drain: behavior a Rust runtime must keep

The output-drain loop is still native. Its callers in pinned upstream:

| Source | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/network/socket.cc` `handle_sendfile` | cork/span/chunk policy; sendfile result, error, progress, completion |
| `src/network/socket.cc` `handle_send` | DATA view, partial-send offset, completion/pop, wait/close |
| `src/network/socket.cc` SendfileRequest | native destructor and queued token creation |
| `src/reactor/base.cc` writable callback | queue-kind dispatch, wait/close, timer cancel, write-interest removal |
| `src/server/reactor_thread.cc` writable loop | same, plus queued bytes, watermarks, close notification |
| `src/server/base.cc`, `master.cc` | queued CLOSE creation, graceful EOF / read-interest |

A Rust runtime must own the whole drain/interest/progress decision rather than
add a predicate next to a duplicated C++ loop. No Rust frame may enclose Zend
allocation, a user callback, an exception or a bailout.

## Accounting and disposal

- A DATA chunk counts toward queued length until it is popped. Advancing its public
  offset does not reduce the Rust queue's accounting. Native token chunks do not
  count DATA bytes.
- DATA destroy callbacks run before the Rust pop, while bytes are live, outside
  Rust, with native noexcept termination. Native tokens are detached from Rust
  first, then their destructor runs once. Do not merge these two orders into one
  Rust `Drop`.
- No borrowed view or Rust guard survives an external effect.

## Branches to preserve

- **DATA**: zero remaining bytes pops without sending. A full send pops. A partial
  positive send advances the offset and waits. A send returning 0 keeps the
  chunk/offset and waits. Close/wait errors keep the front. Ordinary `SW_ERROR` logs
  a warning, keeps the DATA and returns `SW_OK`.
- **SENDFILE**: ordinary `SW_ERROR` pops the token and returns `SW_OK` (unlike
  DATA). Close/wait errors keep the task. Native sendfile updates `begin`, and a
  platform may report partial progress together with an error, so
  begin/result/errno must be read together.
- **Cork**: attempted once based on span and threshold, with a tri-state result.
  A successful completion uncorks before the pop.
- **Reactor/server**: the generic reactor cancels its send timer and removes write
  interest after draining. The server also updates queued bytes, high/low
  watermarks, callbacks and close errno. An empty write queue does not allow
  resuming reads or skipping TLS close_notify.
