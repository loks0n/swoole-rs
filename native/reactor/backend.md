# Reactor construction and backends

Covers `src/reactor/base.cc` construction and the poll/epoll/kqueue backends
(`src/reactor/{poll,epoll,kqueue}.cc`).

## Construction

The constructor's backend plan preserves the requested type and chooses the
compiled factory separately. AUTO keeps epoll priority, then runtime-enabled
kqueue, then poll. An explicitly requested but uncompiled type keeps its
original `type_` value while selecting the poll factory. Native observes
runtime kqueue enablement only when Rust asks at the AUTO decision point.

A zero-initialized phase requests, in order: readiness observation, field
initialization, create-hook observation/invocation, defer-end/defer-exit/idle
installation, main-thread observation/signal installation, try-exit
installation, a fresh trim main-thread observation/installation, and
default-exit installation. Native executes each action after Rust returns; the
factory switch is Native dispatch over the Rust-selected factory. No backend,
function, manager, clock or hook pointer is retained in Rust. The installed
lambda bodies themselves stay Native.

## Kernel event storage

Rust owns a fixed `Vec<MaybeUninit<T>>` of `libc::epoll_event` or
`libc::kevent`; the backend class keeps a borrowed pointer and an opaque owner.
The kernel initializes returned records. Rust neither interprets nor drops the
socket/udata tokens and never resizes the array, so Native wait counts must stay
within the construction bound.

- epoll: `epoll_create` runs before storage creation; `max_event_num` and
  `native_handle` are published after storage succeeds.
- kqueue: keeps its original publish-before-array-creation order. Its private
  pointer is now initialized, so a failed kernel create no longer reaches an
  uninitialized pointer in the destructor.
- Both destructors close the kernel handle before releasing the Rust array.

Checked layouts: macOS arm64 `kevent` 32 bytes, align 4, offsets
0/8/10/12/16/24; Linux aarch64 `epoll_event` 16 bytes, align 8, offsets 0/8.
Other targets are unqualified. The Rust vector plus owner use two allocations
where the original used one.

## Poll snapshot

`PollSnapshot` owns a bounded `Vec<libc::pollfd>` sized once at construction;
reset/push never grow or move it. Native caches a borrowed `pollfd*` and never
frees it. The original `const auto sockets = reactor_->get_sockets()` copy is
still taken before reset and marshalled in the same order. Rust stores fd values
only. Native calls `poll`, interprets the result, looks up the registry, and runs
callbacks, logging, timeout and destruction.

Both `translate_events_to_poll/from_poll` algorithms run in Rust (including
error/HUP suppression when read/write bits are set); the C++ functions are
forwarding shims. `swr_v1_reactor_poll_layout` exposes size, alignment and field
offsets for compiler comparison. Exceeding the configured limit returns failure;
Native throws `bad_alloc` after Rust returns. Negative counts keep Native
`bad_array_new_length`. No concurrent wait/reset/free is permitted.

## Registration

`add`/`set`/`del` on all three backends, poll's event translators and the
interest methods in `swoole_reactor.h` are upstream's code (#336).

## Wait

`wait()` on all three backends is one Rust call, `swr_v1_reactor_run` (#336, #391).
Rust runs upstream's loop: before/begin/kernel wait/result/end/once sequencing,
decoding each `pollfd`, `epoll_event` or `kevent` entry (idle poll entries and
null kqueue tokens are skipped) and the readiness order per socket: read, write,
error unless read or write already ran, then the oneshot removal, each guarded by
a fresh `removed` read. kqueue routes socket, signal and unknown entries. An
uncaught wait failure returns 0 for poll and `SW_ERR` for epoll/kqueue.

Native passes the kernel wait and the effects upstream reaches through `Reactor`
(`before_wait`, begin/end callbacks, `catch_error`, handlers via `get_handler`,
`del`/`_del`, warnings, epoll's io_uring EINTR handler) as `swr_v1_reactor_wait_ops`
function pointers; `running` and `once` are read through pointers. `Socket::removed`
and `event_hup` are bitfields, so small shims read and set them.

The kqueue timeout reply gives a positive millisecond timeout priority over
deferred work, keeps exact second/nanosecond arithmetic, and otherwise passes a
null timeout; Native builds the `timespec`.

## kqueue signals

The signal record path delegates its short-circuit sequence to Rust: observe
activation, then handler presence, then whether the handler differs from
`SIG_IGN`, then request invocation, warning or completion. Each observation is
fresh and taken only where the original code read it. A zeroed 4-byte POD holds
progress; no Signal or function pointer enters Rust. The dispatcher returns
immediately after invocation/logging with no further Signal read.
