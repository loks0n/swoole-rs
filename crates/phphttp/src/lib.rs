//! PHP `Swoole\Http` classes over the zend crates and the httpbindings policy:
//! `Cookie`, `Request` and `Response`. C++ keeps the method tables built from
//! the stubs' arginfo and, until it moves to Rust, the `swoole::http::Context`
//! Request and Response point at; `host` declares what their methods ask of
//! it. A crate of its own so the native gates that link `libswoole_rs_ffi.a`
//! into executables never pull in objects with Zend imports (docs/zend.md).
//!
//! Without the `php` feature the crate is empty.
