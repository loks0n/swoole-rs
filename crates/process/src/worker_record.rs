//! The server's `Worker` record, whose layout Rust owns (`#[repr(C)]`) so the
//! `sw_shm`-backed worker array every process maps is defined here, and the scalar
//! process fields (pid/status/type/id) move behind accessors one at a time. The C++
//! `swoole::Worker` keeps its methods and pointer/atomic fields; a `static_assert`
//! in the patch locks `sizeof`/`offsetof` to this layout, so a mismatch fails the
//! build rather than corrupting shared memory. See #629.
