//! PHP `Swoole\Process`: class registration, constants, objects and every
//! method, and of `Swoole\Process\Pool` with its event callbacks. C++ keeps upstream's method table (built from the stub's arginfo) and
//! the `Worker`, pipe and message-queue objects, which Server and Process\Pool
//! share; the methods reach them through the [`Host`] table C++ passes at MINIT.
//! See docs/zend.md.
//!
//! Without the `php` feature the crate is empty.
