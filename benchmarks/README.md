# Benchmarks

Five response-validated HTTP workloads reuse the corpus applications: plaintext,
small JSON, 1 KiB and 64 KiB binary echo, and the health endpoint of the
multi-file SQLite service. The last measures HTTP dispatch, not database
throughput. All fixtures use one PHP worker, and each engine runs in its own
process. Wall-clock load against a deployed stack is `tools/appwrite_bench.py`.

## Instruction counts (CI)

`benchmarks/callgrind.py` counts instructions per request under callgrind
(Linux, `valgrind` installed), with instrumentation on only while requests are
served. Counts barely vary between runs of the same binaries, so the
hybrid/upstream ratio is stable on shared runners where timings are not.
The merge tier's `callgrind` job runs it for `plaintext`, `echo-1k`, `json` and
`service-health` on the all-modules hybrid and fails if a ratio rises more than
1% above its record in `callgrind_limits.json` (the ratchet; see
[Speed](../docs/migration.md#speed)). On distributions with dynamic PDO modules, pass `--php-extension pdo
--php-extension pdo_sqlite` (the servers run under `php -n`). It uses `echo-1k`
rather than `echo-64k`: how a 64 KiB request is split across reads differs between
runners, and that changes how much of it the Expect-header scan walks (#338).

The same job also runs `websocket` (a WebSocket echo against `06-websocket`) and
`timer` (an endpoint in `08-timers/server.php` that adds and clears a batch of
far-future timers per request): the workloads that exercise those two modules
most, for graduation criterion 3 (#117, #118). They ride the same ratchet in
`callgrind_limits.json`; the fixed +5% graduation ceiling moves to Phase 6 (#430).

```sh
python3 benchmarks/callgrind.py --requests 1000 --workload plaintext --workload echo-1k --limits benchmarks/callgrind_limits.json \
  --engine hybrid=target/hybrid/rust/modules/swoole.so \
  --engine upstream=target/upstream/src/modules/swoole.so
```

Results go to `target/callgrind/<timestamp>/callgrind.json` unless `--output` says
otherwise; a bare `--profiles` keeps the profiles next to them, for
`callgrind_annotate --inclusive=no`.

### Before/after

Build the other commit in a git worktree under `target/`, not a clone or a
scratch directory, so every build and profile stays inside this checkout where
`dev.py prune` can find it:

```sh
git worktree add target/worktrees/base origin/main
(cd target/worktrees/base && python3 tools/build_upstream.py && python3 tools/build_hybrid.py)
python3 tools/build_hybrid.py
python3 benchmarks/callgrind.py --requests 1000 --workload plaintext --profiles \
  --engine base=target/worktrees/base/target/hybrid/rust-buffer/modules/swoole.so \
  --engine branch=target/hybrid/rust-buffer/modules/swoole.so
git worktree remove --force target/worktrees/base
```

## Module microbenchmarks

Native buffer and PHP WebSocket codec microbenchmarks are documented in [the hybrid handoff](../docs/hybrid-build.md). No CPU, RSS, TLS,
coroutine, or database-throughput benchmarks are implemented yet.

For native buffer comparisons, retain both pop-only and `--peek-front` reports
from `tests/modules/buffer/benchmark.py`. The latter reads one byte per DATA
front before pop, exercising repeated cached-front calls and verifying a checksum
outside timing. They are different workloads, not a before/after speedup ratio.
