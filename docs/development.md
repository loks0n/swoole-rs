# Development loops

`tools/dev.py` has three lanes, from fastest to complete:

```sh
# One crate or one named Rust test; no extension build.
python3 tools/dev.py edit --test rollback

# Incremental build, ABI/native/PHP gates and the module's PHPT selection.
python3 tools/dev.py candidate

# Reproduce one registered PHPT (candidate only).
python3 tools/dev.py candidate \
  --case tests/swoole_websocket_server/pack.phpt \
  --hypothesis 'Header changes preserve the PHP frame representation' \
  --expect 'Original pack assertions pass'

# Immutable build, fmt/Clippy, module gates, all applications and all original
# PHPTs, with upstream as control.
python3 tools/dev.py integrate --module timer
python3 tools/dev.py integrate --all-modules   # every registered module; used by CI
```

- `--plan` prints the commands without running them.
- `--test` is edit-only; `--case` is candidate-only.
- Candidate runs only the hybrid; `--compare` also runs upstream. The WebSocket
  differential always runs upstream. Buffer changes select the full PHPT suite.
- `--benchmark` runs benchmarks after the correctness phases (and implies
  `--compare`); skipped if any phase failed. Stop other builds first.
- `--php-extension NAME` passes dynamic PHP modules through to runners.
- `--ccache PATH`, `--fix-halfclose`, `--match-child-php` and the optional
  switches from [hybrid build](hybrid-build.md) are forwarded to the builder or
  runners.
- `--gtest-prefix /abs/prefix` points native coroutine originals at a
  C++14-compatible GoogleTest (see below).

Edit and candidate stop at the first failure; integrate runs every phase and
fails if any failed. Each run writes logs, exit codes, phase durations,
hypothesis and expectation to `target/reports/dev/<UTC-time>-<id>/loop.json`.
For integration subsets, include the phases that produce reports consumed later
in the same run; the planner refuses missing prerequisites.

## Incremental builds

```sh
python3 tools/build_hybrid.py --dev --module timer
```

Dev builds live under `target/hybrid/dev/` with aliases like
`target/hybrid/dev-rust-timer/` and never replace the immutable
aliases. `build-manifest.json` marks them `development`; `last-run.json` records
phase timings and whether make/relink/configure ran.

- Unchanged inputs skip make. A changed Rust archive forces a relink.
- Patched sources are staged from pinned Git objects; only changed files are
  copied, so unchanged mtimes survive.
- Changes to central `native/include/` headers, configure inputs, feature flags,
  toolchain or build-system patches select a new dev tree. Module-local headers
  are copied in and make rebuilds their consumers.
- Edits outside the declared overlays are rejected.
- One writer at a time: a concurrent builder fails instead of waiting.
- A dangling libtool `.lo` whose object was evicted is discarded and rebuilt.

Use immutable (non-`--dev`) builds for comparisons that must be reproduced.

`tools.build_hybrid.apply_patch_verified(tree, patch, targets, expected_sha256=None)`
applies a patch inside its own Git boundary, checks that every declared target
changed, and returns before/after hashes. An apply that leaves a target
unchanged is an error (Git can silently skip patches under an ignored parent
checkout).

## Caches

Plain ccache and cargo, with their usual settings (`CCACHE_DIR`, `CCACHE_MAXSIZE`,
`CARGO_HOME`). The extension builders and C/C++ test harnesses compile through
`ccache` when it is installed; `--no-ccache` disables it for a build.
`php_swoole.cc` always misses because it embeds `__DATE__`/`__TIME__`. CI keeps
the cache in `.ccache`.

## PHPT runner

```sh
python3 corpus/upstream/run.py --engine upstream=target/upstream/src/modules/swoole.so \
  --jobs 4 --module channels --module table
```

`--jobs` batches only an audited list of process-local cases (including HTTP
request parser and WebSocket pack/unpack); timer, fork, listener and
shared-file cases always run in their own process group. `--isolate-cases` runs
one official runner per test. `--case` selects exact paths. Missing, duplicate
or foreign results fail; XFAIL and "passed on retry" warnings count as failures.
Results are saved atomically after each batch with `execution_status` of
`running`, `complete` or `interrupted`.

## Linux environment

`.devcontainer/` is the same OS and packages as the CI runners (`ubuntu-24.04`,
PHP 8.3); `.devcontainer/install.sh` is shared with the merge tier, so the two
cannot drift. Open the folder in any devcontainer host (VS Code, Codespaces,
cloud agent environments), or run it by hand:

```sh
docker build -t swoole-rs-dev .devcontainer
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work swoole-rs-dev bash
```

Tooling tests: `tests/dev/run.sh` (parallel; prints only failing files), or `python3 -m unittest discover -b -s tests/dev` (`-b` hides output from passing tests).

### One command: `dev.py docker`

```sh
python3 tools/dev.py docker -- integrate --module utilities --phase utilities-logger-owned-state
```

Runs any `dev.py` command in the dev image for this host's architecture, with no
manual setup:

- builds the image the first time (tagged `swoole-rs-dev:<arch>-<.devcontainer hash>`,
  so arm64 and amd64 never mix and a changed `.devcontainer/` gets a new image)
- mounts this worktree, and its git metadata, at their host paths
- keeps the toolchain and crate registry in named volumes (`swr-rustup-<arch>`,
  `swr-cargo-<arch>`), and cargo output in `target/docker/`
- inside the container, installs the pinned toolchain, runs `cargo fetch --locked`,
  builds `target/upstream` (cached), and passes the image's PHP extensions to
  `candidate`/`integrate` unless the command names its own
- adds `--with-prerequisites` to a `--phase` selection, so the builds and reports a
  phase needs run first

It warns when the disk has less than 20 GB free. `dev.py prune` also removes
`target/worktrees/*` older than its window and dev images other than the current
one, so nothing needs `rm -rf` outside `target/`.

## Cloud executors

Executor agents (AGENTS.md) run in a cloud environment by default, not on a shared
laptop. The image above is all an executor needs: the toolchain, and `gh` for the
GitHub work. Nothing is installed by hand. In a fresh environment:

```sh
export GH_TOKEN=<token with repo scope>   # the cloud host usually injects this
git clone https://github.com/loks0n/swoole-rs && cd swoole-rs
git config core.hooksPath .githooks        # pre-commit/pre-push checks
```

Then run the executor loop (claim, branch, PR, `gh pr merge --auto --squash`,
`python3 tools/ci.py wait`, close). A GitHub Codespace or any devcontainer host
builds `.devcontainer/` automatically and injects `GH_TOKEN`, so the clone and the
hooks line are the only steps. Keep builds, profiles and clones under the
environment's own disk; `python3 tools/dev.py prune` clears a day's leavings.

## Native core-tests

`tools/native_core.py` builds upstream's CMake/GoogleTest `core-tests` binary from
pinned Git blobs, optionally with module overlays and a given Rust archive, in a
private content-addressed tree.

```sh
python3 tools/native_core.py \
  --source target/upstream/src --config target/upstream/src/config.h \
  --module reactor --archive target/hybrid/builds/BUILD_ID/rust-prefix/lib/libswoole_rs_ffi.a \
  --exclude-unit core-tests/src/coroutine/iouring.cpp \
  --case 'reactor.*' --case stream.send --jobs 2 \
  --output target/reports/native-reactor.json
```

Omit `--module`/`--archive` for the upstream control. No tests run without
`--case` (exact names or globs). Each selected case needs exactly one matching
XML result. Excluded units are reported unsupported and keep the overall exit
status 1.

- On Linux the reference fails to compile `core-tests/src/coroutine/iouring.cpp`
  (tests use optional declarations without guards), so `--exclude-unit` it.
  macOS has further Linux-only compile assumptions.
- The binary is copied to `src/bin/core-tests` before running: pinned `main.cpp`
  finds fixtures relative to `argv[0]/../`.
- macOS needs CMake, nghttp2, libpq, OpenSSL and a C++14-compatible GoogleTest.
  Homebrew GoogleTest 1.18 rejects C++14; build 1.12.1 into a prefix and put it
  first in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, followed by the OpenSSL and
  libpq pkgconfig directories. Pass `--php-dir /opt/homebrew --openssl-dir
  /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3`, and add nghttp2's `pkg-config --libs-only-L` output to
  `LDFLAGS` (pinned CMake links nghttp2 by bare name).
- `--ccache PATH` uses a private 1 GiB cache with `-fdebug-prefix-map`, so
  relocated trees reuse compiler output.

`tools/extension_identity.py` records the identity of an extension binary that
has no build manifest.
