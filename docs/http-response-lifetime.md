# Suspended HTTP response ownership (open problem)

M15's synchronous non-TLS PROCESS-mode early-FIN fix does not cover responses
held by a suspended coroutine; that case still fails. No design is chosen yet.
Constraints found in the pinned source:

- Pipelined requests and coroutine concurrency must keep working. Serializing to
  one request per connection can deadlock an app whose first callback waits for
  the second request, so a single-lease/pause design is not correct. Counted,
  tokened outstanding responses with deferred clean EOF is an untested option.
- The PHP HTTP Context, the core framing Request and M17's wrapper Context have
  different lifetimes and cannot share one handle.
- `onAfterResponse` is concurrency bookkeeping that runs before `end()`,
  `sendfile()` and destructor auto-end. Neither a callback return, a write nor
  entering `end()` means the response was committed.
- Retryable chunk/header failures keep ownership. Terminal failure, close,
  reset/force and worker shutdown cancel it without reviving a closed session.
  Detached or recreated contexts need explicit transfer, and stale completions
  must be rejected by session plus request identity.
- Port parsing can return on removal before consuming a dispatched prefix and
  always calls `recv()` before parsing buffered data, so pause/resume can
  duplicate a request or strand a buffered tail.
- Worker death: `manager.cc` respawns after `process.cc` checks exit status, and
  only nonzero exits run the error callback. `master.cc` `abort_worker` clears
  BASE-mode session state, not PROCESS-mode response ownership. RSHUTDOWN does
  not run on SIGKILL/`_exit`. Response accounting must cancel a dead worker
  generation's tokens and keep healthy idle sessions.

Likely change sites: `src/server/port.cc`, the PHP HTTP server/response sources,
and Context/Connection declarations in `php_swoole_http.h` and
`swoole_server.h`. The sendfile/FIN loss and the `EINTR` chunk-loss fixes are
separate bugs.
