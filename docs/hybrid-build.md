# Hybrid build

The hybrid build links a Rust static library into upstream Swoole's PHP
extension through [ABI v1](abi-v1.md). With no modules selected, the Rust side
supplies only the version/feature queries and all behavior is upstream. One
Swoole extension is loaded per PHP process.

The reference is Swoole v6.2.4, commit
`c7e514509451beafd4d70ce5b78943d51e76381c`, at `target/upstream/src/`. The
builder refuses a different commit or tracked modifications there, and applies
checksum-verified patches from `migration/patches/<module>/` to a separate Git
clone. Do not edit the reference to develop a patch.

## Editing patches

Each module's patches are a branch of the pinned upstream, one commit per patch
file named after it:

```sh
python3 tools/patches.py checkout phphelpers   # target/patches/phphelpers, branch patches/phphelpers
# edit, then amend or fixup the commit for that patch
python3 tools/patches.py export phphelpers     # rewrites the patch files and manifest.json
rm -rf target/patches/phphelpers
```

Upstream changes then surface as ordinary rebase conflicts. Export keeps the
bytes of every patch whose commit diff is unchanged, writes the others as
`git diff` output and drops patch files that no longer have a commit; add a
commit to add a patch. New destinations must be in the module's
`upstream_patch_targets` in `migration/modules.json`, and an edited patch listed
in `frozen_upstream_patches` needs its new sha256 there too.

## Following an upstream release

Rebase every module branch onto the new tag, export, then refresh what the repo
records about upstream files:

```sh
OLD=$(python3 -c 'from tools.build_upstream import COMMIT; print(COMMIT)')
TAG=v6.2.5
modules=$(ls migration/patches)
for m in $modules; do python3 tools/patches.py checkout $m; done
for m in $modules; do
  git -C target/patches/$m fetch -q --depth 1 https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src.git tag $TAG
  git -C target/patches/$m rebase --onto $TAG $OLD   # resolve conflicts as for any rebase
done
# Set VERSION and COMMIT in tools/build_upstream.py to the tag and its commit.
for m in $modules; do python3 tools/patches.py export $m && rm -rf target/patches/$m; done
python3 tools/patches.py rehash $OLD
git grep -n "$OLD"                                  # pins and tags left to update by hand
rm -rf target/upstream && python3 tools/build_upstream.py
```

`rehash` rewrites each recorded sha256 or git blob id of an upstream file that
changed between the two commits, wherever the repo records it, and lists
upstream files that were deleted. It leaves commit and tag references (some are
history) and recorded line counts alone. Then add any new original PHPTs to
`corpus/upstream/manifest.json` (`git diff --stat $OLD $TAG -- tests`), update
frozen patch hashes in `migration/modules.json`, and run the merge tier.

## Build variants

Needs the PHP toolchain from the [corpus instructions](../corpus/README.md) plus
Rust/Cargo. Run from the repository root.

```sh
python3 tools/check_migration.py
python3 tools/build_upstream.py

python3 tools/build_hybrid.py                      # ABI bridge only
python3 tools/build_hybrid.py --backend upstream   # patched build, Rust bridge disabled
python3 tools/build_hybrid.py --module websocket
python3 tools/build_hybrid.py --module buffer --module websocket
```

`--backend rust` is the default; `--module` requires it. Module names and
feature values are listed in [migration modules](migration-modules.md).
[Graduated](migration.md#graduation) modules are in every Rust build and take
no `--module`.
Upstream keeps PHP objects, socket/reactor ownership, protocol dispatch and
native callbacks unless a selected module replaces them.

Shared options (also on `build_upstream.py`): `--jobs N`, `--php-config PATH`,
`--phpize PATH`, `--openssl-dir PREFIX`, `--stdext`, `--php-sockets`,
`--ccache PATH` / `--no-ccache` (ccache is auto-detected and uses its own
settings). The runners' `--php` must match the build
toolchain. Neither builder installs the extension or edits php.ini.

Stable paths point to the latest build of each variant:

| Variant | PHP extension |
| --- | --- |
| Reference | `target/upstream/src/modules/swoole.so` |
| ABI bridge | `target/hybrid/rust/modules/swoole.so` |
| Upstream fallback | `target/hybrid/upstream/modules/swoole.so` |
| Modules | `target/hybrid/rust-<module>[-<module>…]/modules/swoole.so` |

Builds live in `target/hybrid/builds/<input-sha256>/` with `src`, `modules`,
`rust-prefix/` (archive and headers), `state.json`, `build-manifest.json` and
`build.log`. Variant directories symlink into them, so a rebuild can move a
stable path; record the resolved path and SHA-256 that runners print. The
clones share Git objects with the reference checkout, so keep it in place.

The input hash covers backend/modules, pinned commit, ordered patch hashes and
destinations, builder hashes, configure arguments and pkg-config CPPFLAGS,
exported headers, the Rust archive, toolchain versions and compiler environment.
A cached build is reused only if its source diff, pin and artifact checksum
still match; otherwise the builder refuses and leaves the directory for
inspection. Patch hunk offsets must be exact; a patch that only applies with
an offset is rejected. Builds are traceable but not byte-identical: upstream
embeds `__DATE__`/`__TIME__`.

`--export /absolute/new-directory` copies the DSO, Rust archive, config,
manifest, Makefile and build log of an immutable build into a new directory
with an `export.json` receipt. It never replaces an existing export and is
rejected with `--dev`.

`--dev` uses an incremental tree; see [development](development.md).

## Optional build switches

All default off and get their own alias suffix and manifest input.

| Switch | Requires | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--fix-halfclose` | — | M15 native patches: drain queued output before close. No Rust feature bit. Changes behavior relative to the reference; does not make general TCP half-close work. |
| `--http-rewrite-store` | `--module http` | Rust-owned HTTP rewrite-rule storage (`--enable-swoole-rs-http-rewrite-store`). |
| `--http-static-config` | `--module http` | Rust-owned `StaticConfig` and static consumers. Changes the public Server configuration fields and layout; rebuild SDK consumers. |
| `--http-legacy-directory-store` | `--module http` | Rust-owned legacy StaticHandler directory catalog. Old compiled `std::set` callers are not compatible; rebuild consumers. |
| `--buffer-typed` | `--module buffer --module reactor` | Rust Buffer cursor with converted Socket/reactor/server callers. Legacy mutable DATA front/allocation is refused in this mode, so unconverted consumers break. |
| `--string-direct-fields` | `--module buffer` | Rust operates directly on the five `String` member fields. Only arm64 Darwin with the Apple compiler is accepted. |
| `--reactor-{iov,defer,sockets}-owned` | `--module reactor` | Rust-owned iov/defer/sockets storage. |

## Timer module

`--module timer` (feature value 4) is opt-in only. `tests/modules/timer/test_fork.py`
checks forking from an active timer callback, which aborted the child in the
first adapter.

## Running the corpus and PHPTs against builds

```sh
python3 corpus/run.py \
  --engine hybrid=target/hybrid/rust/modules/swoole.so \
  --engine upstream=target/upstream/src/modules/swoole.so \
  --require-all --output target/reports/corpus-hybrid.json

python3 corpus/upstream/run.py \
  --engine hybrid=target/hybrid/rust/modules/swoole.so \
  --engine upstream=target/upstream/src/modules/swoole.so \
  --require-all --output target/reports/phpt-hybrid.json
```

Runners use `php -n`. Where PHP modules are dynamic, pass
`--php-extension pdo --php-extension pdo_sqlite --php-extension curl
--php-extension sockets` (and `tokenizer` for the Hyperf project) consistently
to every command. Do not pass these for modules built into PHP (Homebrew):
duplicate-module warnings break PHPT output. PHPTs run through PHP's official
runner; never use upstream's custom runner or `tests/start.sh`.

Benchmarks, after builds and tests have finished:

```sh
python3 benchmarks/run.py \
  --engine hybrid=target/hybrid/rust/modules/swoole.so \
  --engine upstream=target/upstream/src/modules/swoole.so \
  --requests 5000 --concurrency 1 16 --warmup 20 --repeat 3 \
  --output target/reports/benchmarks-hybrid.json
```

These localhost measurements can be client-limited and do not measure codec
throughput. Module-specific gates are in [validation](validation-suite.md).
