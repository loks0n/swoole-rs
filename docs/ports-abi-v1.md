# ListenPort and PHP Port boundary (M25)

Feature value 8388608 (`--module ports`). Upstream targets:
`src/server/port.cc`, `ext-src/swoole_server_port.cc`. Follows the
[policy/effect split](abi-v1.md#policyeffect-split).

Rust owns callback-free policy: native defaults, protocol selection,
listener/option/setup policy and PHP Port settings. TLS setup (context creation,
SNI registration and selection, SNI wildcard matching with libc case folding,
per-socket TLS), socket import and `close` are whole Rust operations
(`swr_v1_ports_run`, `crates/ports/src/lifecycle.rs`) over the same op call as
the receive callbacks. Sockets, socket options, OpenSSL calls, DTLS sessions,
Zend conversion, object/property custody, allocation, logging and callbacks stay
native, as do the callback, SNI, session and connection containers. Return values, errno, warnings, partial
publication and cleanup order match upstream.

The receive callbacks (`readable_callback_*`: raw, length, EOF, Redis and HTTP)
are whole Rust operations (`swr_v1_ports_on_read`, `crates/ports/src/read.rs`).
Rust runs each callback's control flow, including HTTP pipelining, the HTTP/2
preface, WebSocket handover, multipart uploads, chunked bodies and size limits,
and asks native code for every fact or effect through one `call(context, op,
arg)`: `recv`, buffer fields, request getters and parser steps, canned replies,
logs and dispatch. Native and unchanged: `destroy_http_request`, the request
parser itself, worker generation and suspended-response handling.

HTTP RequestV2 (`SWOOLE_RS_HTTP_REQUEST_V2`, off by default): with M04's Rust
request, the HTTP receive callback's ops and `destroy_http_request` use typed
allocation/reuse/access/delete. The HTTP/2 stream flag does not choose the deletion type.
Cleanup keeps multipart and borrowed buffers, and teardown never touches the
socket buffer M08 has already released. A ports-only build must compile without
HTTP Rust symbols.
